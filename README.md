------------------------------------------    Animated Buttons Effects By @ShreyaSingh     --------------------------------------------


I have created a project that consists of 16 buttons with different animation effects. The project is made entirely of HTML and CSS.

* *  Here is a more detailed explanation of the project: * *

# The project uses HTML to create the basic structure of the buttons, such as the divs and spans that make up the buttons.
CSS is used to style the buttons, such as setting the background color, font size, and border radius.
# The animation effects are also created using CSS. For example, one button might have a fade-in animation when it is hovered over, while another button might have a bounce animation when it is clicked.
